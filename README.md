Hello there!! 

My name is Ruud de Kruif. 

I am relatively new in the programming world. In November 2015 i started an re-education course.
In this course i've learned all about java and object-orriented programming. 

From that day on things went fast. I now work as junior developer at Caesar Experts in Utrecht, Netherlands.
My main activities nowadays are based on web development with Sitecore and .NET MVC.
